title: "Reflection on the Use of GenAI"
---

For this project, I used **ChatGPT** by OpenAI to assist me in completing various aspects of the assessment. The tool helped me by providing clear guidance on formatting content in Markdown, structuring my website, and suggesting creative ideas for the pages. It also simplified the technical aspects, like editing the `_quarto.yml` file, and offered quick solutions to challenges I faced.

I found GenAI incredibly beneficial for tasks that required rapid problem-solving and efficient content creation. Its ability to understand my needs and offer precise recommendations saved me a lot of time. However, one challenge I encountered was ensuring that the content generated was aligned with my personal style and intent. This required me to review and adapt the suggestions to make them feel authentic.

Overall, using GenAI was a productive experience, and it demonstrated the potential of AI in streamlining creative and technical workflows.
