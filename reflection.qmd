title: "Reflection on the Use of GenAI"
---

For this project, I used **ChatGPT** by OpenAI to assist me in completing various aspects of the assessment. The tool helped me by providing clear guidance on formatting content in Markdown, structuring my website, and suggesting creative ideas for the pages. It also simplified the technical aspects, like editing the `_quarto.yml` file, and offered quick solutions to challenges I faced.

I found GenAI incredibly beneficial for tasks that required rapid problem-solving and efficient content creation. Its ability to understand my needs and offer precise recommendations saved me a lot of time. However, one challenge I encountered was ensuring that the content generated was aligned with my personal style and intent. This required me to review and adapt the suggestions to make them feel authentic.

It has also helped me to solve errors quickly regarding Github pages and coding formatting errors within less than a minute. Even though the codes are generated by ChatGPT, I personally feel this allows me to adapt and learn the new tools quickly without much hassles.

Overall, using GenAI was a productive experience, and it demonstrated the potential of AI in streamlining creative and technical workflows.
